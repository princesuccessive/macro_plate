    This mixin is used for adding link buttons to changelist for related models
    to the parent admin class.

    We have two admins for Conference and Banner (has ForeignKey to Conference)
    models, Conference admin url is:

        - /admin/conferences/conference/123456/

    The mixin adds `Banner` button to `Conference` admin that redirects
    user to this url:

        - /admin/conferences/banner/?conference__id__exact=123456

    For use the mixin need to add to Admin class the mixin and
    ``related_models`` attribute:

        class ConferenceAdmin(RelatedObjectActionsMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
            # ...
            related_models = (Banner,)

    Also `related_models` objects can be a tuple instead of just model. In that
    case mixin will search for specific field in model (instead of finding it
    automatically). For example, `Banner` has `conference` ForeignKey field:

        related_models = ((Banner, 'conference'),)

    Buttons added using DjangoObjectActions. See method ``change_actions``.

    Note: `related_models` is a required attribute, but if you want to skip it,
    then set `related_models = False`.

    Attributes:
        related_models (tuple): tuple of related model definitions.
